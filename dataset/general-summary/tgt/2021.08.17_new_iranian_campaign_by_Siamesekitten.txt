The report analyzes a phishing campaign by the Iranian threat actor group Siamesekitten targeting companies in Israel. The goal is to gain access to infect corporate networks. The attack starts by contacting victims via LinkedIn with fake job offers. This directs them to a phishing site impersonating a legitimate company. The site hosts malicious Excel and executable files to infect victims. The malware analysis examines two backdoors used - Milan and Shark. Both communicate via DNS tunneling to C2 servers. Milan gathers system info while Shark can download additional payloads. The infrastructure uses fake recruitment sites for the phishing and compromised servers posing as IT services for C&C. Registration details tie the servers to the threat actor. In total, the report provides a comprehensive look at Siamesekitten's latest tactics, tools, infrastructure, and targets. It demonstrates their ongoing espionage operations aimed at corporate networks, now expanded to phishing schemes.
