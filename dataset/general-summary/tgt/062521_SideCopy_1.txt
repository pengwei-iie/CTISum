The document outlines research by Cisco Talos on cyber espionage campaigns conducted by a threat actor group they call SideCopy. SideCopy uses themes and tactics similar to another threat actor known as APT36 or Transparent Tribe to target government entities in India and Pakistan. SideCopy utilizes social engineering tactics like malicious LNK files, document decoys, and honeytraps to infect victims with remote access trojans like CetaRAT, DetaRAT, Allakore, and njRAT. They have rapidly evolved their malware arsenal since 2019, developing several custom RATs and modular plugins for reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration. Post-infection, they deploy plugins for keylogging, stealing browser credentials, enumerating files, and exfiltrating data like authentication databases for India's Kavach multi-factor authentication system. Targeting revolves around themes of interest to the Indian military, diplomatic personnel, think tanks, and honeytraps. This shows an intent to compromise government entities, similar to Transparent Tribe. Their infrastructure verifies requesters are from India or Pakistan before delivering payloads. The requests are logged for tracking victims. Cisco Talos recommends customers detect and block this threat using security products like Secure Endpoint, Secure Email, Firewall, Stealthwatch, Threat Grid, Umbrella, and Secure Web Appliance. In summary, the research outlines an increasing espionage threat by SideCopy against the Indian subcontinent using tactics mimicking another threat actor Transparent Tribe. Their rapid evolution in tradecraft and malware shows their intent to aggressively compromise government entities.
