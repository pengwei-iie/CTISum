The document is a cyber threat briefing from the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) about an ongoing cyber espionage campaign by the threat actor group APT27 against German businesses. APT27 has been active since at least 2010 and the BfV has observed an increase in attacks against German targets using the malware variant HYPERBRO. Since March 2021, the attackers have been exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Zoho ManageEngine software to deliver the HYPERBRO malware. The malware allows the attackers to steal business secrets and intellectual property. They may also try to infiltrate the networks of customers and service providers (supply chain attacks). The document provides technical details on how HYPERBRO works, including its components, installation process, execution process, network communication, and indicators of compromise.  HYPERBRO uses obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection. It communicates with hardcoded command and control servers operated by the attackers. The BfV recommends that organizations check their systems against the provided indicators of compromise, review network logs for connections to C2 servers, and use the provided detection rules to look for infections. Organizations should contact the BfV cyber defense group if they detect signs of compromise. The briefing aims to help businesses identify and defend against attacks by the APT27 group.
