SkinnyBoy gathers system information like running processes and files before sending it to a command and control server. It can then download additional payloads. Fancy Bear used commercial VPN services to anonymize their activity when managing the malware infrastructure. The report examines the technical details of each component of the SkinnyBoy malware, including persistence mechanisms and communications. Based on victimology and TTPs, SkinnyBoy aligns with Fancy Bear's interests in targeting military and government organizations. The report provides detection rules to identify the malware. Overall, it profiles a new backdoor from Fancy Bear tailored for cyberespionage, despite having a relatively low level of sophistication compared to their prior operations.
