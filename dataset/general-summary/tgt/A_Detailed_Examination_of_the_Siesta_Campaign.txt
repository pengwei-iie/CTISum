FireEye examined a campaign called Siesta that was reported on by TrendMicro in March 2014. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the Siesta campaign are consistent with the Chinese cyber espionage group APT1, also known as the Comment Crew. FireEye observed the Siesta campaign targeting a telecommunications customer using a spear-phishing email with a malicious zip file attachment in February 2014. The zip file contained an executable that connected back to a command and control server. The TTPs match previous APT1 activity, including spear-phishing to gain an initial foothold and callback traffic to a fake legitimate looking website. Malware samples from the Siesta campaign contained resources also found in previous APT1 malware dating back to 2010-2011. The same resources were also found in malware from an unrelated group called Menupass. This indicates the groups either share tools and infrastructure, or use shared "binder" tools that disguise malware as legitimate files like PDFs. Based on the evidence, the Siesta campaign was likely conducted by APT1, or an unknown group using similar tools and tactics. The analysis shows the value of tracking old indicators of compromise, as well as those shared between groups, to improve network defense.
