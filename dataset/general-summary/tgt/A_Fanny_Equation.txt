The article discusses findings by Kaspersky Lab related to a worm named Fanny that was found in 2008. Fanny used two zero-day exploits that were later incorporated into Stuxnet in 2009 and 2010. Fanny spreads via USB drives and uses the filename "fanny.bmp". It leverages the same LNK exploit as Stuxnet to propagate even if Autorun is disabled. It also uses an escalation of privilege exploit patched later in MS09-025. Fanny installs a backdoor on systems that gathers system information and connects to a command and control server. It can communicate via hidden storage on USB drives for air-gapped systems. The malware uses advanced techniques not typical of cybercriminals. Analysis of the code shows similarities between Fanny and Stuxnet, indicating the developers followed common guidelines. Over 11,000 infections were observed across many countries, with most in Pakistan. The origins and purpose of Fanny are unclear, but its sophisticated capabilities for targeting air-gapped systems suggest it may have been used to map networks later compromised by Stuxnet. The early access to zero-days and overlap with Equation Group also indicates a link.
