The report analyzes a new IoT botnet called EwDoor that is targeting AT&T customers through vulnerabilities in Edgewater Networks devices. EwDoor was first observed on October 27, 2021 and has gone through several iterations, with its main capabilities being DDoS attacks and backdoor access. The botnet infects EdgeMarc devices to steal sensitive information and carry out DDoS attacks. The analysis examines EwDoor's technical details including its persistence mechanisms, device profiling, command and control communication, and anti-analysis protections. Key findings are that it uses BT trackers to retrieve C2 servers and TLS to encrypt traffic. During a brief visibility period, the botnet was tracked to around 5,700 infected devices located in the US and tied to AT&T's network. The true scale is estimated to be much larger based on certificate analysis. Overall, the report sheds light on a sophisticated new IoT botnet that is actively exploiting devices to compromise telephone networks. It provides an in-depth review of EwDoor's workings and capabilities as an emerging threat to monitor.
