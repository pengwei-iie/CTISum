1. Initial Compromise: EwDoor exploits the Nday vulnerability CVE-2017-6079 to gain access to AT&T devices. 2. Establish Foothold: The initial shell script sets up persistence via crontab and downloads the EwDoor malware. 3. Internal Recon: EwDoor collects information about the infected device including hostname and IP address. 4. Command and Control: Encrypted C2 information is decrypted. Communication uses TLS and BT trackers. 5. Actions on Objectives: EwDoor receives commands from C2 like DDoS, reverse shell, and scanning. 6. Maintain Presence: Cron jobs and self-updating ensure EwDoor persists on compromised devices for continued control.
